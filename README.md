# Crowd-Image-to-Density-Maps-using-cDCGANs
Currently working with the Computer Vision Lab at Stony Brook University for generating density maps from crowd images

My goal is to build a model that very accurately generates the density maps from crowd images using conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.

The project is in the nascent phase.
